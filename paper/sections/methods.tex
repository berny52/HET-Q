\section{Methods}
\subsection{Classical Solution Sampling}
We use WalkSAT with noise parameter $p=0.5$ and 100 steps per instance. Solutions are filtered at $\geq 75\%$ satisfaction ratio.

\subsection{Graph Construction}
Solution graphs are constructed using Hamming distance $\leq 2$ as connectivity criterion. Network metrics include diameter, clustering coefficient, and degree distribution.

\subsection{Quantum Circuit Design}
Grover circuits are implemented with Qiskit 1.1.0, using optimal iteration count $O(\sqrt{N/M})$ for $N=32$ total states and $M=18$ solutions.
