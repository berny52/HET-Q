This paper introduces HET-Q, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for structured SAT solving. We demonstrate that solution spaces of random 5-variable SAT instances exhibit small-world network properties (diameter 3, clustering coefficient 0.551). Leveraging this structure, we implement a optimized Grover search circuit requiring only 5 qubits and 34 gates. Our results show measurable quantum acceleration potential with 100-shot simulations on Qiskit Aer. The framework provides a reproducible pipeline for quantum-enhanced constraint satisfaction.
